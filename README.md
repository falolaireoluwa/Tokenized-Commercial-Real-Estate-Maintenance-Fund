# Tokenized Commercial Real Estate Maintenance Fund

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how commercial property owners manage building maintenance through transparent asset registration, condition monitoring, collective fund management, and democratic expenditure governance.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized system for managing maintenance funds for commercial real estate. It enables property owners to collaborate on funding building maintenance through tokenized shares, ensures transparent tracking of building conditions, and creates democratic processes for approving maintenance expenditures.

## Key Components

### Property Registration Contract
- Records details of commercial buildings within the maintenance fund network
- Stores property specifications, floor plans, and system schematics
- Creates unique digital identifiers for each property
- Maintains ownership records and participation stakes

### Condition Assessment Contract
- Tracks building systems and components with detailed condition ratings
- Stores inspection reports and maintenance histories
- Estimates remaining useful life of major systems
- Creates predictive maintenance schedules based on condition data

### Fund Contribution Contract
- Manages deposits from property owners based on predefined formulas
- Issues tokens representing shares in the maintenance fund
- Tracks contribution history and fund balances
- Enables transparent accounting of all financial activities

### Expenditure Approval Contract
- Handles authorization for major repairs through stakeholder voting
- Creates transparent proposal and bidding processes for contractors
- Manages payment releases based on work verification
- Maintains complete records of all maintenance spending
